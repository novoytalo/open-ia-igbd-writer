```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

#Under construction.
##This project implements:
-Next.js
-Typescript
-FireBase as Server data and Auth
-Basic token encryption
-Open AI as API
-Using IGBD API (an API that provides Games information, text data, images and videos)
###Goals:
Create a platform that will consume the IGBD API, identify and authorize users, consume the FireBase database and, in case of not having data, create a call in OpenIA to create text by artificial interligence.

###Secondary objectives:
Use only CSS and TypeScript for the frontend

What's working: API paths and some basic navigation and authorization functions.
